								During development, several members of the group have been assigned to document development and documentation changes.

								Any problem that canâ€™t be resolved internally will require external help by professor David Brown during lecture or office hours.

									<h4>7.3.1 Problems Encountered</h4>
								</a>
							</div>
							<div class = "subtopicBody2">
								<p>During development we ran into three major problems: 
									database integration, retrieving data for certain federal graphs, 
									and the search bar. Although we were able to get a database working, 
									we struggled to integrate it into our site properly. To rectify this, we instead 
									converted the raw information into a JSON file, allowing for us to easily read and 
									display the data without a database.
								</p>

								<p>Another issue we encountered was retrieving data for our heat map and pie chart. 
									While these two graphs displayed the information of all thirteen provinces and territories, 
									our JSON file for federal information did not make this distinction. 
									Due to time constraints, we were unable to resolve the issue at the time 
									of the latest version the software was delivered. The resolution that was 
									implemented at the time of the latest version for the software was using manually 
									inputting the static data. The next step in resolving the issue would be to integrate a 
									working product that can display our COVID-19 data dynamically. This feature will be 
									included in a future build of COVIDaware.</p>

								<p>Our final major issue was in implementing the search bar. 
									We were having issues with drawing information from the input field. 
									Due to time constraints, the search bar had to be removed in the latest deliverable.</p>
